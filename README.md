# Python Journey From Zero To Hero üöÄ

This repo contains me learning **Python** from zero to hero. Though I've some experience learning python months ago, but I've not really done a detailed documentation.

## Inspiration üß†

I'm learning python because it is a child of the **C** programming language and a flexible, efficient high level programming language. It is great for automation, AI and ML, and also building web applications. For now, I'm focused on using **Python** to do 2 things automation and building **APIS** bcause I'm currently building my backend skills. I'm also intrested in the **Godot Game Engine** and the **Godot** in built language called **GDScript** is very similar to **Python** so it is a win win üòÖ. Game development is a passion I'm going to build and work on. It must not die, mark my words. Also learning **Python** gives me opportunities to explore **AI and ML** because we're in that era. All in one I can't wait to become comfortable in **Python** just like I'm in **TypeScript**.

## Resources üìï

As usual I'm learning from one of my favourite teachers. **Mosh Hamedani** This man is soo incredible, I can't wait to meet him in the future and appreciate him for his works. I learnt **NodeJS** from him, I also learnt **Redux** from him. Sooner or later, I would learn from his **React-Native** and his **C#** tutorials too. Until I become world class. I mean world class üöÄ

## What Am I Going To Build ‚ùì

Well, I'm going to build a game yeah, I've experience with building web games and I know how things work, sprite animation, collision detection and all. I would be using the **PyGame** library, I would be using **Python OOP** principles where every game character is an object and they have different properties and all. I would also build this game backend API with Python too, I would be using **Django** or that, sounds fun right, yeah that's exactly what I'm going to be building after learning the important concepts. The game would've a high score system, a leaderboard system, and more. And by the grace of God, It would be **Open Source** because why not?

## Comrade You Too Dey Cap üòÇ

Enough talking, show me the code ü§£, so yeah let me map what've learnt from **Mosh Videos** Apart from normal stuffs every programming language has, **Python** makes some things really easy,

## What've Learnt ü§è

1. What Python is
2. Who built Python and what language it was built it, Linters, Autopep8 etc.s
3. Fundamentals of Python, printing Hello World.
4. Variables and Arithmetic Operations, there I learnt that using

```python

# using // in your arithmetic operation would automatically give you an interger not a float, eg

num1 = 20
num2 = 3

# would give an integer
result = num1 // num2

# prints 6
print(result)

```

Also **Mosh** mentioned something called the **augmented** operator, this simply means

```python

# using an arithmetic operator with an assignment operator eg

num1 = 5

num2 = 5

# Let's use it here

num2 += num1

# this is what we call the augmented operator. We could do the same like this

num2 = num2 + num1

## but com'n man that's repetitive, I'm not saying it is bad, but it's not clean code.
```

5. Control Flow, if statements, elif statements and else statement. I also learnt something funny which I couldn't really answer. Let me test your knowledge. **Mosh** asked this question What's an expression ? it sounds easy but it was kinda complex to think of and funny how interviewers can ask this and you think you know the entire language already ü§£ but you don't know simple concepts. Well an expression is simply a piece or block of code that produces a result.

6. Loops, while loop, for in loop and that's where I'm currently at, I also learnt that the **range** function is actually a data type, it is a complex data type and it is an iteratable, which means you can loop over it just like strings. Now trying to get the type of the range function returns a range which tells us that it is a data type too.
